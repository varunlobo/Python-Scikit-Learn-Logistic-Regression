Using Logistic regression to classify breast cancer dataset into malignant vs benign. 

The dataset was downloaded from the Scikit-Learn library. The performance of our model was determined using the confusion matrix. 

The purpose of this notebook is to demonstrate my knowledge in implementing logistic regression model on a dataset. Logistic regission is a popular supervised machine learning algorithm used in classification.
